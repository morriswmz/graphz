# graphz

Temporary place for my helper module which I use in my graph related experiments.

Mainly used to load various graph datasets (do remember to cite the original authors if you use their datasets). Implemented some basic analysis methods. You can use `.networkx()` to convert the loaded datasets to `networkx` graphs for more sophisticated analysis.
